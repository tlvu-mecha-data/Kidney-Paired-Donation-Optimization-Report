In this project, we will tackle the complexities of the KPD process. Our goal is to use Operations Research tools and techniques
to find optimal matchings of incompatible donor-recipient pairs. By leveraging data sets of incompatible pairs, we will develop 
strategies to match these pairs in a way that maximizes the number of successful transplantations.

The pie chart illustrates the percentage distribution of individuals who were successfully matched versus those who were not,
based on a cycle length of 2, within a total network of 724 nodes. The chart shows that 45.3% of the individuals were successfully matched, 
while 54.7% were unmatched. This indicates that almost half of the individuals in the network were paired successfully into cycle lengths of 2,
while the majority remained unmatched.

The stacked bar chart shows the effect of number of donors (1, 2, and 3) on matching success. Donor counts of 1 and 2 had a
relatively high percentage of matches, while donor count 3 had no matches (100% unmatched).
